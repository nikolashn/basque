.SH DESCRIPTION
Basque intends to be a general-purpose statically-typed procedural programming language, similar to C, but with some improvements.
The C Basque compiler currently statically compiles for Linux x86_64 ELF, ahead of time, and takes ASCII input.
.PP
When the C Basque compiler is invoked with an source file argument, it will compile and assemble the source code into an executable file (there is no linker or preprocessor).
.PP
A single dash "\-" can be used as the source file argument to read source code from standard input.
.SH OPTIONS

.BR \-h ", " \-\-help

Write the current version of the C Basque compiler to standard output, then exit.
.TP
.BR \-o " file"
Output compiled code into an executable file at the specified path. To write to standard output, use a dash "\-" as the "file" argument. If this argument is not provided, and the input file name is "filename.ba", the output file will be "filename". Otherwise, the output file will be called "out".
.TP
