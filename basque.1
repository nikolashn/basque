.SH DESCRIPTION
Basque intends to be a general-purpose statically-typed procedural programming language, similar to C, but with some differences and improvements.
The C Basque compiler currently statically compiles for Linux x86_64 ELF, ahead of time, and takes ASCII input.
.PP
When the C Basque compiler is invoked with an source file argument, it will compile and assemble the source code into an executable file (there is no linker or preprocessor).
.PP
A single dash "\-" can be used as the source file argument to read source code from standard input.
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BR \-o " file"
Output compiled code into an executable file at the specified path. To write to standard output, use a dash "\-" as the "file" argument. If this argument is not provided, and the input file name is "filename.ba", the output file will be "filename". Otherwise, the output file will be called "out".
